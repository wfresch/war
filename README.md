# War

War is a game similar to rock-paper-scissors.  Typically, two players stand face-to-face and pretend as if they're in a gunfight using their hands to form gestures in the forms of a gun or different shields.  

In this player vs computer version, the player chooses their move as a computer randomly chooses its move.

The rules are as follows:

1. Before every move, the players count to 3 simultaneously.
2. On 3, each player flashes one of the following moves:
  - Load: Symbolized by pointing one's fake gun upwards, this provides 3 ammo for each player.  A typical game of War begins with both players using their first move to Load.  A player cannot shoot unless they have ammo.
  - Shoot: Symbolized by shooting a finger pistol at the opposing player.  If player A shoots player B, player A wins _unless_:
      - player B blocks, in which case the round is a draw.
      - player B reflects, in which case player B wins.
  - Block: Symbolized by placing one's arms across their chest in an X-pattern.  A Block prevents a bullet from ending the game and causes a draw.  A player may use Block up to 5 times consecutively.  
  - Reflect: Symbolized by touching one's thumbs and pointer fingers together, making a small diamond pattern.  This move reflects the bullet back at the shooter and wins the round if a bullet was deflected.  A player may use Reflect up to 3 times consecutively.
